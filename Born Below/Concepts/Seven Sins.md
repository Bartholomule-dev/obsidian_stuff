# Seven Sins

The core stat system used by both demons and mortal characters.

## The Seven Sins

| Sin | Demon Stat | Mortal Need | When Need is Low |
|-----|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Wrath** | Combat damage | Security | Feels threatened |
| **Envy** | Social manipulation | Standing | Covets others' status |
| **Pride** | Defense/HP | Esteem | Craves validation |
| **Greed** | Resource gain | Wealth | Desperate for money |
| **Lust** | Charm/seduction | Desire | Seeks forbidden pleasure |
| **Gluttony** | Endurance | Comfort | Overindulges to cope |
| **Sloth** | Speed/stealth | Purpose | Loses motivation |

## For Demons

Demons have stats in each sin (typically 1-20 range):
- Higher stats = more effective at exploiting that sin
- Primary stat affects abilities and growth
- Stats increase through training and leveling

## For Mortals

Mortals have needs (0-100 scale):
- 100 = Fully satisfied
- 50 = Neutral
- 10 = Critical (corruption threshold)
- 0 = Completely broken

## Pressure Mechanics

When a demon applies pressure:
1. Demon's sin stat determines effectiveness
2. Target's need is reduced
3. Low needs trigger desperate behaviors
4. Desperate behaviors advance corruption stage

## Vulnerability

Characters may be **vulnerable** to specific sins:
- Vulnerable needs take extra pressure
- Resistant needs take reduced pressure
- Vulnerabilities revealed through mission intel
