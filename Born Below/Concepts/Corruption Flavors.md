# Corruption Flavors

When a character reaches their breaking point, the **lowest need** determines their corruption flavor.

## Flavor Outcomes

| Need (Lowest) | Flavor | Personality Outcome |
|---------------|--------|---------------------|
| Security | **Broken** | Compliant, traumatized |
| Standing | **Bitter** | Vindictive, sabotaging |
| Esteem | **Tyrant** | Authoritarian, cruel |
| Wealth | **Corrupt** | Transactional, bribable |
| Desire | **Obsessed** | Addicted, scandal-prone |
| Comfort | **Decadent** | Wasteful, indulgent |
| Purpose | **Hollow** | Apathetic, nihilistic |

## Narrative Meaning

Each flavor represents a distinct psychological transformation:
- **Broken:** Fear destroyed their sense of safety
- **Bitter:** Lost status made them vengeful
- **Tyrant:** Shattered self-worth creates compensatory cruelty
- **Corrupt:** Poverty made everything transactional
- **Obsessed:** Unfulfilled desires became consuming addiction
- **Decadent:** Discomfort drove them to excess
- **Hollow:** Lost purpose drained all meaning

## Mechanical Effects

Corruption flavor affects:
- Available post-corruption schemes
- Character's utility to Hell
- Narrative flavor text
- Ripple effects on relationships

## Strategy

Target the need that produces the most useful corruption flavor for your goals:
- Need a spy? Create a **Bitter** or **Corrupt** character
- Need a puppet? Create a **Broken** character
- Need chaos? Create a **Decadent** or **Obsessed** character
