# Demon Ranks

Demons are categorized into ranks that determine their power ceiling and status.

## Ranks

| Rank | Level Cap | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Lesser** | 12 | Common imps and low-tier demons. Seek to prove worth. |
| **Greater** | 15 | Advanced demons with higher potential and status. |
| **Archdemon** | 20 | Pinnacle of demonic power. High-level commanders. |

## Rank Effects

- **Level Cap:** Maximum level demon can reach
- **Equipment Requirements:** Some items require specific ranks
- **Training Requirements:** Some activities require minimum rank
- **Base Stats:** Higher ranks start with better stats
- **Soul Cost:** Higher ranks cost more to recruit

## Progression

Demons cannot change rank during play - it's an intrinsic property. Rank represents their place in the infernal hierarchy.
