# HeatCalculationService

Calculates divine heat generated by missions based on suspicion levels, active verbs, targets, and locations.

## Overview

HeatCalculationService determines how much divine attention (heat) a mission generates. High heat contributes to intervention risk.

## Key Responsibilities

- Calculate daily heat from active missions
- Break down heat sources for tooltips
- Track modifier contributions
- Feed heat to intervention risk meter

## Key Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `calculate_daily_heat()` | Compute heat for mission state |
| `get_heat_breakdown()` | Itemize heat sources |
| `get_modifier_tooltips()` | Generate UI tooltip text |

## Dependencies

- `MissionStateData` - Mission context
- [[Intervention Risk|InterventionRiskMeter]] - Heat destination

## Heat Sources

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Base Heat | Mission type baseline |
| Suspicion | Target's awareness level |
| Verbs | Aggressive abilities add heat |
| Location | High-profile areas add heat |
| Cult Heat | From cult activities (15% rate) |

## Heat Flow

```
Mission Actions → HeatCalculationService → InterventionRiskMeter → Intervention Checks
```

## Strategic Importance

Heat is the core risk/reward tension:
- Aggressive play = faster corruption + higher heat
- Conservative play = slower corruption + lower heat
- High heat = divine intervention risk
